# Google Earth Engine (GEE) Tank
The compilation of Google Earth Engine (GEE) JavaScript (.js) codes to be used to extract, analyze or download the image satellite data provided by the platform.

###### tags: `how-to` `gee` `remote sensing` `anecdata`

This repository compiles the straight-to-work code for your practical uses academically or for work. The codes are strictly in JavaScript and is to be implemented 'organically' in its original environment at the [Google Earth Engine Code Editor]('https://code.earthengine.google.com/') platform.

## 🌱 If you're new to GEE here are a few notes for you
- The platform, **Google Earth Engine** is a fully *ONLINE* platform. It is not a software and its interface is via a website.
- It requires you to have a Google account and to utilize this platform you have to sign-up and register. Please do so at this website 👉🏻 [https://signup.earthengine.google.com/](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/') before you proceed any further.
- **GEE** is not a fully-functioned solution to the auxilliary needs of a geographical information system (GIS). Thus, it is a tool to view, extract, process and analyze publicly available satellite data. 
- You do not need to aspire to be fluent in JavaScript to be able to use this platform. You can use it so long as you know what you want to achieve at the platform i.e. visualize data, extract the data, classify the data etc.

The code here are tried and tested to serve the purposes of getting what you need from Google Earth Engine without too much hassle at the time of development/study. Feel free to inform me should there be any outdated ones.
